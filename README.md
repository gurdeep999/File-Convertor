# File-Convertor
This is a prototype app for a file convertor API i'm planning to build.

Currently it only supports csv to json and json to csv conversion.

I'll be adding more file types. (Like docs to pdf and gif to png or png to gifs,etc.)

When enough file types have been added, the backend can be abstracted to create an API service for fellow developers.
